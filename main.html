                using Musou Isshin in combat for a certain duration afterward. The DMG dealt by Musou no Hitotachi and Musou Isshin's attacks will 
                be increased based on the number of Chakra Desiderata's Resolve stacks consumed when this skill is used.<br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Musou Isshin</b><br/>
                While in this state, the Raiden Shogun will wield her tachi in battle, while her Normal, Charged, 
                and Plunging Attacks will be infused with <span class="w3-text-purple">Electro DMG</span>, which cannot be overridden. 
                When such attacks hit opponents, she will regenerate Energy for all nearby party members. 
                Energy can be restored this way once every 1s, and this effect can be triggered 5 times throughout this skill's duration.
                While in this state, the Raiden Shogun's resistance to interruption is increased, and she is immune to 
                <span class="w3-text-purple">Electro-Charged</span> reaction DMG.
                While Musou Isshin is active, the Raiden Shogun's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG will be considered Elemental Burst DMG.<br/>
                <br/>
                The effects of Musou Isshin will be cleared when the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.<br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Chakra Desiderata</b><br/>  
                When nearby party members (excluding the Raiden Shogun herself) use their Elemental Bursts, 
                the Raiden Shogun will build up Resolve stacks based on the Energy Cost of these Elemental Bursts.<br/>
                The maximum number of Resolve stacks is 60.<br/>
                <br/>
                The Resolve gained by Chakra Desiderata will be cleared 300s after the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.

        Raiden’s good Constellations are concentrated into C1-3. 
        While it may be tempting to “max out” your Raiden by going for 2 or 3 more copies of her, consider this:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">Raiden’s full team damage at C0 is comparable to most other teams without 5* Constellations, 
            and C3 with C6 5* teams; 
            pulling for her early Constellations is essentially a cheaper buy for a different carry’s max potential, 
            but only in terms of damage and without a gameplay change.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">Since they offer no gameplay change, they really only translates to faster clear times. 
            If you already have the investment to clear content at C0, her Constellations won’t do anything for you beyond speed.</li>

        Raiden’s gearing process is more complicated than the average unit, as her kit brings a hard to maintain balance between DMG%, 
        ATK%, and ER% which translates to comfort, DMG%, and potentially ATK%.<br/>
        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px">Sands: ER% or ATK%</span><br/>
        <p>
          Thanks to Raiden’s A4, Emblem of Severed Fate, a part of ER% is converted into DMG%, 
          as well as helping generate more Flat Energy with her Elemental Burst. 
          That being said, <b>ATK% sands will be the preferred choice for her personal damage in most scenarios</b>, 
          but ER% sands can range from 10% less personal damage to a negligible 
          &lt; 1% difference depending on outside buffs.

        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px;">Goblet: Electro DMG% or ATK%</span>
        <p>
          The prevalence of DMG% sources in Raiden’s kit can allow an ATK Goblet to be a comparable option in some narrow situations, 
          such as without <b>external ATK buffers</b> 
          such as:<em> Yoimiya, Xiangling, Sara, Bennett, Lynette, Aloy, Chevreuse, etc</em>,
          with <b>significant external DMG% buffers</b>
          such as:<em> Kazuha, Furina, Mona, Sara, Sucrose, etc</em>, 
          without ATK Sands, and/or with high Base ATK weapons, but in most cases Electro DMG% will be her best choice given equal substats. 
        </p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px;">Circlet: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG</span>
        <p>
          Pick whichever brings you closer to a &frac12; ratio of CR/CD, taking into account other sources of CR and CD such as
          <b class="infoPopUpTxt" onmouseover="infoPopUp('wpTheCatch')" >The Catch</b>
          <img src="img/Weapon_The_Catch_2nd-min.png" class="infoPopUpImg" id="wpTheCatch"/>
          or Sara’s C6.  
        </p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px;">Substats: CR = CD > ATK% &ge; ER > Flat ATK</span>
        <p>
          The balance between ER% and ATK% can vary as discussed with her Sands choices, but CRIT will always be more valuable than both. 
        </p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px;">Elemental Mastery on Raiden?</span>
        <p>
          With the advent of Dendro, Elemental Mastery has become a more valuable stat for Raiden due to her ability to trigger Aggravate 
          and Hyperbloom reactions. However, its value varies heavily on how many of these reactions she is able to trigger; generally, 
          sticking to standard builds for Raiden in an on-field role is a safe option. That said, if reactions can be triggered consistently 
          then Elemental Mastery can gain value and the stat should not be considered as wasted if played in such teams.
          Moreover, Raiden can also more comfortably now assume a mostly off-field role as a Hyperbloom trigger – in these styles of teams, 
          it is recommended to build Raiden fully focusing on Elemental Mastery.
        </p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 20px;">ER requirement? </span>
        <p>
          There is no “correct” answer to this, as it depends on what you wish to accomplish. 
          Raiden as a unit will value ER beyond just a requirement to cast her Elemental Burst, 
          as ER% will translate into both DMG% and Flat Energy refund to both herself and her teammates. 
          As such, her ER can fluctuate a lot depending on the chosen weapon and sands. <br/>
          <br/>
          Typically, 200%+ ER will be enough for her to battery herself even as solo Electro in most teams that don’t 
          have atrocious Energy generation. This is easy to reach with an ER Sands or weapon, and hits a nice breakpoint 
          of 20 Energy per Burst at TL10. Due to its ER secondary stat and propensity to value ER sands, Engulfing Lightning 
          will often reach 250%+ ER before the bonus ER from the passive.

          as well as ER conversion to Burst DMG% on 4pc. Combined with her A4 passive, it allows Raiden to build ER while strengthening her damage. 
          Simply equipping ESF onto Raiden will grant 20% ER, 38%+ Burst DMG, 8% Electro DMG and 1.5 extra Energy generation. 
          All of these stats may seem small at first, but they add up and get better the higher her ER goes. <br/>

          If you ever find that another set can give you higher damage, either in Genshin Optimizer or in game, 
          that does not mean it is a good alternative. It means you need to farm ESF more.

          She can boost her own reaction damage with 4

          Alternatively, she can also opt to use more supportive artifacts such as 4

              <td class="drop-down-content" id="dropDownReactioncontent">
                Reactions such as Electro-Charged and Overloaded can add some damage to Raiden’s teams, but they will be relatively unimportant for most units who would not otherwise 
                seek to build EM. As such, Raiden will not build around them, but her team can. However, Aggravate and Hyperbloom serve as reactions Raiden can directly take advantage 
                of – the ways this affects her build is discussed in Artifacts. <br/>
                <br/>
                Xiangling has innate EM from ascension, and thus serves as a better Overloaded trigger than most other units who would seek to build for talent damage rather than 
                Transformative Reaction damage. Raiden alone can struggle to keep up Electro against Xiangling’s Pyro application, so additional application from Yae or Fischl 
                can help maintain Electro as aura and Pyro as trigger. <br/>
                <br/>
                Electro-Charged allows both Hydro and Electro to persist as auras, which can allow Xiangling to Vaporize her Burst and Skill damage and gain further value from EM 
                to the point where she can consider looking for it on her Sands or weapon and in substats. Electro-Charged does consume some Electro gauge, but it will not typically 
                do so fast enough to reduce Overloaded procs, and Hydro can serve as a means to wipe Pyro if Xiangling does happen to overtake and become aura. <br/>
                <br/>
                Most Anemo supports with the exception of Jean outside of Sunfire setups will trigger enough Swirls to make building EM ideal for their personal damage, 
                even without any other Reactions. However, because Swirl applies Elemental Gauge in AoE and because many Anemo units are able to absorb Elements into their 
                Skills and/or Bursts, Anemo units are additionally capable of serving as triggers for Electro-Charged and Overloaded. Because they would have high EM built already, 
                these Reactions can be significant gains for their personal and team damage. <br/>
                <br/>
                While Overloaded has a higher base multiplier, Electro-Charged can allow Anemo units to additionally increase their damage by offering two auras they can potentially 
                Swirl. <br/>
                <br/>
                In single-target, Swirl will consume Gauge without reapplying it, which can complicate questions of reaction ownership and reduce Anemo units’ contributions even 
                beyond halving their Swirl damage. <br/>
                <br/>
                Jean does not have any abilities that can absorb an Element, and she triggers relatively few Swirls per rotation. 
                However, her Burst field will apply Anemo to the on-field character, allowing her to take advantage of a unique synergy with Bennett’s Pyro self-application to 
                trigger up to 10 additional Pyro Swirls every rotation provided units stay within her and Bennett’s Bursts—this interaction is often called “Sunfire” after a 
                League of Legends item with a design reminiscent of a Pyro Swirl animation. <br/>
                <br/>
                These Pyro Swirls can also be Vaporized when paired with a Hydro enabler and can trigger Overloaded to further leverage whatever EM she builds. 
                Similarly to Xiangling, Raiden alone can struggle to maintain Electro aura against Sunfire, but Yae, Fischl, or a Hydro enabler can help keep Jean as 
                Overloaded trigger.

          Extra damage will always be nice for faster and more consistent clears, while extra survivability can provide comfort to a point but is typically unnecessary. 
          Thus, most teams will limit themselves to one healer or strong shielder as a support, and will ideally look for units for this slot that can bring any additional utility. <br/>
          <br/>
          Often, strong shielding can be favored outside of corrosion matchups as a source of survivability, as it provides interrupt resistance that can enable smoother rotations 
          and prevent DPS loss from being staggered by enemies or needing to dodge. However, as Raiden’s Burst already grants her infinite interrupt resistance, this benefit does not 
          apply to her, so healing and shielding just end up as alternative means of not dying, with shielding being limited against enemies that can apply corrosion.

                      Xiangling is recommended to be run alongside Bennett, since she can snapshot to fully benefit from his ATK buff and because even with Raiden she will face Energy issues as solo Pyro. 
                      Her Pyro application can make consistent Electro VV challenging in most teams, as Raiden will struggle to keep up Electro aura without additional off-field application. 
                      Intentionally absorbing Kazuha’s Burst with Electro can avoid this issue, or Xiangling can be used in place of a VV unit. 
                      Despite these limitations, Xiangling’s personal damage is significant enough to justify her placement with Raiden in many teams.

                      Yanfei gains a relatively powerful shield at C4, but her ER requirements are stiff and she lacks the Pyro self-application that Thoma and Bennett have. 
                      She is capable of running TTDS, but will likely struggle to find enough ER to do so as solo Pyro even paired with Raiden. 
                      Her synergy is limited to being one more of many mediocre options for providing survivability.

                      Thoma’s shield has the potential to be the second strongest shield in the game, beaten only by Zhongli. 
                      Furthermore, with proper setup, he can apply Pyro for certain Anemo units to absorb to trigger Overloads with. 
                      However, his synergy is extremely limited otherwise—Raiden cannot benefit from his C6 buff, and he thus lacks the buffing capability of many competitors. 
                      Moreover, his shield’s unique method of stacking providing unparalleled stagger resistance is undermined by Raiden’s infinite poise. 
                      Thus, while he is an option, he faces stiff competition for his slot.

                        Raiden will lower Xingqiu’s ER requirements, reducing the value of Sacrificial Sword and Favonius Sword as compared to his typical teams. Favonius Sword still matches his ER requirements before C6 nicely and may still provide some utility to the rest of the team, but Sacrificial Sword will only serve to increase rotation length and is recommended against at any con.

                      Xingqiu stands to provide a significant amount of value for Raiden teams. Firstly, his personal damage is very significant, further bolstered by Raiden’s Burst Damage Bonus and teamwide batterying as well as potential VV. Furthermore, due to his significant off-field Hydro application, he can consistently enable Electro-Charged even with other elements being applied, thus allowing for Hydro and Electro auras to persist simultaneously. Thus, he can allow Pyro units like Xiangling or Anemo units like Kazuha or Sunfire Jean to Vaporize and Overload against enemies consistently, bolstering team damage. While his contribution is significant, his Hydro application being single-target lowers his value in AoE, and he is a highly contested unit which Raiden does not require in order to function. Additionally, his 21s Skill cooldown can slightly increase rotation lengths. However, when available, he is undoubtedly worth considering.

                      While Xingqiu and Yelan tend to perform similar roles in Raiden teams, there are a few nuances to note between using them. Yelan can provide more personal damage while contributing her ramping A4 buff, as well as possessing shorter cooldowns which can allow for tighter rotations in some teams.. That said, Xingqiu’s extra 3 seconds of Burst duration, higher Hydro application and added defensive utility are all important and situationally crucial – particularly in the case of when used alongside Xiangling. However, both units will tend to perform similarly – and can be especially potent when used together, albeit highly limited to single target damage.

                      Mona is a potent buffer for Raiden, bolstering her damage significantly. While her Omen duration is short, this is alleviated to some degree by Raiden frontloading significant damage in her initial slash. As a TTDS holder, she faces strong competition for her slot. Both C6 Sara and Lisa will be an improvement over her once buff uptimes are taken into account, but Mona can be better than Lisa for initial slash screenshots. Her Hydro application is relatively limited, but it can allow for some Electro-Charged procs from Anemo teammates, though not nearly to the degree of Xingqiu or Kokomi.

                      While outclassed in any individual role, Kokomi provides nearly unrivaled role compression in Raiden teams. She is able to hold TTDS in order to buff Raiden, and either provide further buffs through ToM or some off-field damage via OHC. Her healing is significant, and she can maintain full uptime on her jellyfish, which also allows for off-field Hydro application, potentially enough to sustain some Anemo units to consistently Vaporize or Overload. As such, she is a valuable member for Raiden teams.

                      Yae possesses high off-field damage and a powerful Elemental Burst, whose ER needs are made manageable by pairing her with Raiden. Thus, she can achieve a high damage profile, with Raiden/Yae teams being able to compete with other maximum potential Raiden teams. Due to providing a source of consistent damage, Yae allows Raiden teams to deal significantly better with multi-wave content, while their combined Burst damage allows them to still deal well with limited DPS windows.

                      While she lacks Yae’s immense Burst damage, Fischl also provides significant off-field damage through Oz. Her role is simple, but nonetheless quite effective—though it is worth noting that her damage is constrained significantly to Single Target.

                    <p>
                      The Shogun’s right-hand woman, and her premiere buffing option. Pre C6, in terms of raw buffing potential, she faces stiff competition from TTDS Lisa and Mona, who are cheaper to build and typically better single unit buffers. Sara can pull ahead of her competitors if using Elegy, and at C6, Sara’s buffing power is entirely unmatched and she becomes a prime pick for Raiden. Sara is also able to buff multiple units using her Skill, C2, and Burst, which can be an added advantage when paired with secondary damage dealers such as Yae, Fischl, or Xiangling. Further, Sara’s Burst damage can be relevant on Raiden teams due to being able to benefit from many of the buffs being directed to Raiden. As such, while Raiden can work without her, they have excellent synergy together that is always worth consideration.<br/>
                      Since Sara’s buff uptime is limited, it can be a small optimization to switch your Raiden combo to 2x N3C + N1C + N3C to buff an extra CA; however, simply doing your normal preferred combo is still perfectly fine.

                      Despite being perhaps unfairly frowned upon as a unit, Lisa can offer a lot to Raiden teams. With her ER issues solved by Raiden’s Energy restoration, Lisa can use her Burst to provide a full uptime 15% Defense shred and can hold TTDS to further buff Raiden. Her buff is competitive with Mona and pre-C6 Sara, while possessing the benefits of being completely F2P, extremely cheap to build and gear, and being relatively uncontested. Even with TTDS, her personal damage is not negligible, particularly when she is able to benefit from many of the buffs being directed to Raiden.

                      Kuki serves as an excellent healer option on Aggravate and/or Hyperbloom teams, as she can contribute reasonable personal damage through these reactions while also providing healing and buffs through 4TotM. Outside of these teams, however, she is rarely ever the best option — even then, the teambuilding flexibility she provides is helpful.

                      Qiqi’s healing is nothing short of incredible, and able to provide copious amounts of survivability to the team. With 4 Ocean-Hued Clam, she also has the capacity to convert this healing into off-field damage, bolstered further by Superconduct. That said, her lack of Particle generation is a hole the rest of the team will have to work around, and even with Raiden Qiqi requires an extremely significant amount of ER in order to Burst every rotation.

                      Diona provides a great amount of survivability to Raiden through her shielding and healing, and combined with her stamina reduction, she can make Raiden very comfortable to play. That said, she lacks any sort of synergy with Raiden, her healing ticks are slow, and her utility through shielding is greatly diminished by Raiden’s infinite poise during Burst. As such, other options can often outperform her.

                      Kazuha is the premier anemo buffer for Raiden teams, and it is easy to see why- his DMG% buff boosts Raiden and other damage dealers, he contributes significant personal damage himself, especially when enabled to trigger Electro-Charges and Overloads, and his grouping is valuable to Raiden in AoE.

                      Venti’s unparalleled grouping allows him to consistently trivialize floors where his suction works. Outside of this, he can struggle with his Burst missing, but his personal damage and Energy refund are still valuable enough to be worth consideration.

                      Heizou has some versatility aside from his access to VV shred that allow him to function as a decent budget Anemo option on Raiden teams. Where applicable, he can use TTDS, Prototype Amber or Hakushin Ring to provide additional team utility – alternatively, with proper investment, his personal damage with his fully stacked Elemental Skill can be significant. Furthermore, he has access to decent grouping at C2. That said, his low Burst cost limits the amount of resolve stacks Raiden can gain, and his utility options and damage are still usually worse than what Kazuha or Jean can provide in his place.

                      While often considered a budget option on Raiden teams, Sucrose can apply VV, provide buffs via TTDS or Hakushin Ring, and offer good grouping as Raiden enables her to be able to Burst every rotation, albeit needing to build ER. Unfortunately, in most teams she cannot pass TTDS to Raiden without creating rotation conflicts, and her EM buff is of minimal value. Her C6 can be significant for Raiden, but it is difficult to consistently absorb her Burst with the right element.

                      Jean has significant utility for Raiden – alone, she has reasonable personal damage, healing, and VV all in one slot, compressing the roles a Raiden team needs. Further, her C2 buff can be valuable to execute better combos on Raiden. Her damage contribution sees a dramatic increase when paired with Bennett – their self-elemental application allows for consistent Pyro swirls, giving Jean high personal damage and the ability to control chain reactions. In such a case, she shifts towards preferring to build EM.

                      GMC’s Skill and Burst deliver high impact hits with low field time and ER requirements, and their C1 offers a respectable team buff. Their field can work to prevent enemy knockback, allowing Raiden to take full advantage of her AoE capacity, though they do require players to be aware of construct placement to avoid the field turning into another obstacle for the player.

                      Albedo’s role in Raiden teams is straightforward—he is a free source of additional off-field damage, and a conditionally powerful Burst. However, he lacks much particular synergy with Raiden, and his Burst has a low cost of 40 thus limiting the Resolve stacks she gains.

                      Zhongli provides the strongest shield in the game, as well as universal Res shred, but Raiden gains little from the quality of life shielding can otherwise provide thanks to her complete interruption resistance, and has access to easy VV setups that offer greater Res shred. Zhongli’s Burst animation is long, for limited damage as a return on investment, and his Burst cost is low. He can provide survivability for Raiden, but not much else.

              Dendro units are primarily used in order to enable various Catalyze and/or Hyperbloom reactions that add a considerable boost to Raiden’s damage. 
              While the current roster does not have characters that can match Raiden’s best buffers or off-field DPS units, the power boost they provide is nonetheless appreciable 
              and can be considered for team building flexibility. However, they tend to come with additional drawbacks – other elements such as Pyro can trigger reactions that remove 
              Catalyze, reducing these units’ value, and the other Dendro reactions outside those mentioned are generally not optimal for Raiden to make use of. <br/>
              <br/>
              It is worth noting that though the reactions triggered here allow Raiden to benefit from EM, whether this warrants a change in her gearing is undergoing further testing. It is recommended that for now players build Raiden as they normally would, as her performance on such a build is known and remains strong. This said, Raiden can also be used in a mostly off-field role in Hyperbloom teams, using her Elemental Skill to trigger reactions – if played in such a capacity, a full EM build is warranted.

                      Nahida’s unique AoE mechanics, good personal damage, strong EM buff and high Dendro 
                      application all cement her as a very potent option on all styles of Raiden teams looking to use Dendro reactions, allowing them to be competitive with Raiden’s best teams. 
                      She is mostly used in an off-field capacity for an on-field Raiden; however, the archons can choose to switch roles in some Hyperbloom teams where Nahida can provide on-field 
                      Dendro application to produce Dendro cores for Raiden to react off of. In this role, Nahida is relatively uncontested due to her mix of strong on-field and off-field 
                      Dendro application.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      Nahida’s C2 causes her value to further skyrocket, and cements her as one of Raiden’s best teammates. 
                      It is worth noting that while she is very strong, Nahida further increases some of Raiden’s struggles with handling wave-based content.

                      Yaoyao provides healing and off-field Dendro application for Raiden; this allows Raiden to play Dendro-based teams without having to worry about fitting in proper defensive utility. It is worth noting that in Hyperbloom teams it is worth pairing Yaoyao with an additional Dendro unit, as her poor solo application will result in a low rate of Dendro Core generation.

                      Raiden and Alhaitham will generally compete too much for field time if both are used on-field, requiring one of them to change their roles; Alhaitham can act as a Quickswap DPS for an Aggravate Carry Raiden, or Raiden can act as an off-field Hyperbloom trigger for an on-field Quickbloom Alhaitham.

                      Collei and DMC perform very similarly – both offer steady off-field Dendro application to enable reactions, alongside providing minor buffs. They are mostly interchangeable, with minor nuance’s over one another. Collei’s advantages are her ability to hold Elegy for the End, if available, for a significant team buff, as well as being able to slot into shorter 18s rotations where applicable.

                      As mentioned above, Collei and DMC are relatively interchangeable, with the differences between them being minor. DMC’s advantages are his higher Burst cost, which generates more resolve for Raiden, as well as having a longer lasting Dendro application. When using him, however, care should be taken to let his lamp absorb Hydro or Electro, as absorbing Pyro will pre-emptively disrupt his Dendro application.

                      Tighnari can seem like an appealing option for Raiden teams – his personal damage with Spread reactions is significant, something that the other Dendro units cannot match. However, his low Burst cost does not generate much resolve for Raiden; furthermore, while his required field time is low it nonetheless conflicts with Raiden, causing rotations to become awkward.

          These are not an exhaustive list of Raiden’s teams by any means, or a ranking of her best teams. 
          They were selected for their potential to illustrate team building strategies- the best teams for your account will depend on your account and your goals.
        </p>
        <span class="text-bold">Sara-Kazuha-Bennett</span>
        <p>
          Sara provides an ATK buff and at C6 a powerful Electro Crit DMG buff for Raiden, plus some limited Burst damage capacity of her own. Kazuha provides VV and his A4 Electro DMG% buff to both Sara and Raiden, as well as dealing significant personal damage through Swirls and Overloads from his Pyro absorbed Burst. Bennett provides the strongest ATK buff in the game, healing, and a means for Kazuha to absorb Pyro into his Burst. Raiden batteries her team, buffs their Burst damage- though the DMG% means little to Kazuha and Bennett’s damage is negligible without any reactions or any other buffs, so this means the most to Sara, provides a source of Electro aura for Kazuha, and deals enough damage to build a team around.
        </p>
        <span class="text-bold">Yae-Sara-Jean</span>
        <p>
          Yae deals strong Burst and off field damage, as well as serving as a second source of Electro particles for Raiden and Sara. Sara provides her ATK and at C6 her Electro Crit DMG buff for Yae’s Burst and for Raiden, as well as her own Burst damage. Jean provides VV and healing. All three teammates have high Burst costs, with Yae tied with Raiden for the highest cost in the game, allowing Raiden to generate substantial Resolve stacks. Raiden batteries her team, especially valuable here as beyond just her flat energy refund her high particle generation means more to Electro teammates, buffs their Burst damage, and deals her own damage on field.
        </p>
        <span class="text-bold">Xiangling-Xingqiu-Bennett</span>
        <p>
          Xiangling Vaporizes her Skill and Burst damage from off field, as well as triggering Overloads, allowing this to become the only team built around Raiden on field where a unit other than Raiden makes up the highest share of team damage. (Note that Raiden will end up overtaking Xiangling’s damage again with C2-3.) Xingqiu enables Xiangling to Vape through his Hydro application, as well as dealing significant personal damage. Bennett buffs both Xiangling and Raiden, heals, and provides an additional source of Pyro particles for Xiangling. Raiden batteries her team, buffs their Burst damage, provides a source of Electro aura for Xiangling, and deals her own damage on field.
        </p>
        <span class="text-bold">Sucrose-Fischl-Bennett</span>
        <p>
          Sucrose provides VV, and is able to carry TTDS for Raiden. Her Burst absorption can be inconsistent, but if she absorbs Pyro she can trigger Overloads for a respectable personal damage contribution, and if she absorbs Electro then she has the opportunity to provide an Electro DMG% buff to Raiden if she is C6. Fischl deals Skill damage from off field and generates additional Electro particles for Raiden. Bennett buffs Fischl and Raiden and serves as a healer. Raiden batteries her team and deals her own damage on field.
        </p>
        <span class="text-bold">Lisa-Venti-Kokomi</span>
        <p>
          Lisa provides her A4 Def shred and is able to carry TTDS for Raiden. She can deal some damage with her Burst as well, but it will be very limited using TTDS and without significant buffs. Venti provides VV, his A4 energy refund likely for Kokomi, the best grouping in the game, and deals significant personal damage through Swirls and Electrocharge chain reactions. Kokomi enables Venti to trigger Electrocharge with her Hydro application, provides healing, and can choose to run either 4pc Ocean Hued Clam for additional off field damage or 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith to buff Raiden and Lisa. She can additionally run Hakushin Ring, though it will realistically have very limited uptime for Raiden, or TTDS to pass to Venti, though the ATK% will be less impactful for the full EM builds preferred in teams where he can sometimes trigger Electrocharge reactions. Raiden batteries her team, buffs their Burst damage, together with Lisa provides a source of Electro aura for Venti, and deals her own damage on field.
        </p>
        <span class="text-bold">Kokomi-Nahida-DMC</span>
        <p>
          An off-field Raiden team using on-field Kokomi alongside Nahida and DMC to trigger Hyperbloom. Kokomi consolidates good Hydro application, damage and healing, the last of which is especially necessary in these styles of teams due to the high Dedro Core production. Nahida and DMC together provide significant off-field Dendro application, enough to achieve good Dendro Core production even in Single Target situations; Nahida also contributes a decent amount of personal damage in her own right to the team. It is worth noting that while Electro transfiguration on DMC’s Burst is optimal for Dendro Core production in Single Target, Hydro transfiguration can be useful in AoE situations and the choice between the two is not overly significant.
